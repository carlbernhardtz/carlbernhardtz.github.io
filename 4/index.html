    <h1>Project 3: IMAGE WARPING and MOSAICING</h1>
    <h1>Part A</h1>
    <p>The goal of this project was to warp images and change their perspective and subsequently create a panoramic looking image.
    
    <h2>Recover Homographies</h2>

    <p>
        The <code>computeH</code> function calculates the homography matrix \( H \) that maps points from one image to another using corresponding point pairs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        For each point pair \( (x_1, y_1) \) in <code>im1_pts</code> and \( (x_2, y_2) \) in <code>im2_pts</code>, we append two rows to matrix \( A \):
        </p>
        
        <p>
        $$
        \begin{pmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -x_1 x_2 & -y_1 x_2 \end{pmatrix}
        $$
        $$
        \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & x_1 & y_1 & 1 & -x_1 y_2 & -y_1 y_2 \end{pmatrix}
        $$
        </p>
        
        <p>
        We solve for \( h \) using least squares and reshape it into the final homography matrix:
        </p>
        
        <p>
        $$
        H = \begin{pmatrix} 
        h_{11} & h_{12} & h_{13} \\
        h_{21} & h_{22} & h_{23} \\
        h_{31} & h_{32} & 1 
        \end{pmatrix}
        $$
        </p>

    <p> Then a provided online tool was used to set the correspondences and then the triangulation was made using the 
        <em>scipy.spatial.Delaunay</em> function in python. This resulted in the triangular meshgrid displayed below.
    </p>

        </figure>
    </div>

    <h2>Computing the "Mid-way Face"</h2>


    <p>The next task was to compute the mid-way face of the two images, i.e the midway morph of the two images. This was done by computing 
        the average shape of the triangulation with the following formula: $$\text{Average points} = \text{Carl's points} * 0.5 + \text{Jacob's points} * 0.5$$
        Then the inverse of the affine transformation matrix was computed between the triangles in the images. Using the 
        <em>skimage.draw.polygon</em> function, masks were made for every triangle. These masks were then used to warp all pixels inside the
        triangular mask instead of looping over every pixel. The triangles were warped using an inverse warp. Lastly, a cross-dissolve was used
        to blend the colors of the images. The results are presented down below.
    </p>

            <figcaption>Jacob</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>


    <h2>The Morph Sequence</h2>

    <p> The next task was to create a sequence of the warps so you can see how one image gradually turns into another. Using different 
        fractions of the warping and cross-dissolving coefficients \( \in [0,1] \) this resulted in a morphed sequence with 45 different 
        images and a frame rate of 30 fps. I also made a morph sequence between Mark Zuckerberg and Matthew McConaughey. The results are 
        shown below.

            </figure>
        </div>
    <h3>The "Mean face" of a population</h3>
    
    <p>Now it was time to compute the average face of a population. The dataset I chose only consists of 37 images of Danish 
        people where 30 are male and 7 are female. The average shape of Danish males and females respectively, were computed and then the 
        images were warped into this shape. Below are some examples.
    </p>
    <div class="image-gallery">
        <figure class="image-item">
            <img src="media/dane1.png" width="350" >
            <figcaption>Original image</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="image-item">
            <img src="media/dane_warp1.png"width="350">

    <div class="image-gallery">

            <img src="media/danef1.png" width="350" >
            <figcaption>Original image</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="image-item">
            <img src="media/danef_warp1.png"width="350">
            <figcaption>Warped image</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="image-item">

        <figure class="image-item">

            <figcaption>Warped image</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>


    <p>To compute the average face, all of the warped images were added together and then by calculating the mean of these images the average
        was computed. This was done for males and females separately. As you may notice the average male face looks a bit smoother and in my
        opinion more computer generated. This is probably due to the fact that the dataset for the males is more than four times as large and 
        thus a more averaged image could be achieved.
            <div class="image-gallery">
                <figure class="image-item">
                    <img src="media/avg_m_dane.png"  width="450">
                    <figcaption>Average male Dane </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <figure class="image-item">

                </figure>

            </div>

    <p>After having computed the average Danish faces my face was warped into the average Danish male face and the average Danish male face
        was warped into mine.
    </p>
            <div class="image-gallery">
                <figure class="image-item">

                </figure>
            </div>
    
    <h2>Caricatures: Extrapolating from the mean</h2>
    <p>In the last part a caricature from my face was made by extrapolating from the population mean in the previous part. I tried using
        different alphas, below are two examples of this.
        <div class="image-gallery">
            <figure class="image-item">
                <img src="media/carl_c05.png"  width="450">
                <figcaption>Alpha = 0.5</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure class="image-item">
                <img src="media/carl_c15.png"  width="450">
                <figcaption>Alpha = 1.5</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
    <h2>Bells and Whistles</h2>

    <p>For the bells and whistles I tried to change my gender using the average female Danish face. This was done by both warping my face
        to the average female Danish face but also dissolving the images. The result was not too great though unfortunately. One reason for this is that
        all of the images of the Danish females were taken with a green background which makes the dissolve a lot worse. </p>
        <div class="image-gallery">
            <figure class="image-item">
                <img src="media/carl_dane_f.png"  width="450">
                <figcaption>Me as a Danish woman</figcaption>
